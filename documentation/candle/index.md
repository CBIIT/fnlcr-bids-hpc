There are three pages in this documentation for using CANDLE on Biowulf:

1. [How to run CANDLE on Biowulf](https://cbiit.github.io/fnlcr-bids-hpc/documentation/candle/how_to_run_candle_on_biowulf): Go here first to run working examples/templates in order to get a feel for how things work
1. [How to modify the CANDLE templates](https://cbiit.github.io/fnlcr-bids-hpc/documentation/candle/how_to_modify_the_candle_templates): Go here next to learn how to modify the templates to run your own model using CANDLE
